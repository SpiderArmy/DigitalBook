## 🔐 What is Identity and Access Management?

Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a framework of policies, processes, and technologies that ensures the right individuals have access to the right resources at the right times for the right reasons. IAM is fundamental to cybersecurity as it controls who can access what within an organization.

### The IAM Challenge

Organizations face a complex challenge: **providing seamless access to legitimate users while preventing unauthorized access from attackers**. This becomes increasingly difficult as organizations grow, adopt cloud services, and face sophisticated threats.

### 1. **Authentication (Who are you?)**

Authentication verifies the identity of users attempting to access systems or resources.

#### Authentication Factors

**Something You Know**:
- Passwords, PINs, security questions
- **Strengths**: Easy to implement, familiar to users
- **Weaknesses**: Can be guessed, shared, or stolen

**Something You Have**:
- Smart cards, security tokens, mobile devices
- **Strengths**: Hard to duplicate, can be revoked
- **Weaknesses**: Can be lost, stolen, or damaged

**Something You Are**:
- Fingerprints, facial recognition, voice patterns
- **Strengths**: Unique to individual, cannot be lost
- **Weaknesses**: Can be spoofed, affected by injury/illness

#### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

MFA requires users to provide multiple authentication factors, significantly improving security.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[User Login] --> B[Username/Password]
    B --> C[Verification]
    C --> D[Second Factor]
    D --> E[Access Granted]
    
    B --> B1[Knowledge Factor]
    D --> D1[Possession Factor]
    D --> D2[Inherence Factor]
    
    style A fill:#e3f2fd
    style B fill:#f3e5f5
    style C fill:#e8f5e8
    style D fill:#fff3e0
    style E fill:#fce4ec
```

**MFA Examples**:
- **Password + SMS Code**: Common but vulnerable to SIM swapping
- **Password + Authenticator App**: More secure, offline capability
- **Password + Hardware Token**: Highest security, physical device required

### 2. **Authorization (What can you access?)**

Authorization determines what resources and actions a user can access after successful authentication.

#### Access Control Models

**Discretionary Access Control (DAC)**:
- Resource owners control access permissions
- Flexible but can lead to permission proliferation
- Example: File sharing in operating systems

**Mandatory Access Control (MAC)**:
- System-enforced access policies
- Rigid but highly secure
- Example: Military and government systems

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
- Access based on user roles
- Scalable and manageable
- Example: Employee roles in organizations

**Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**:
- Access based on user, resource, and environmental attributes
- Highly flexible and context-aware
- Example: Time-based access, location-based restrictions

### 3. **Accounting (What did you do?)**

Accounting tracks and logs all user activities for audit and security purposes.

#### Logging Requirements

- **Authentication Events**: Login attempts, successes, failures
- **Authorization Events**: Resource access, permission changes
- **User Activities**: Commands executed, data accessed, changes made
- **System Events**: Configuration changes, security events

## 🏢 Active Directory: Microsoft's Directory Service

Active Directory (AD) is Microsoft's directory service that provides centralized authentication and authorization for Windows networks.

### What is Active Directory?

Active Directory is a hierarchical directory service that stores information about network resources, including users, computers, groups, and organizational units (OUs).

### Active Directory Structure

    style D fill:#fff3e0
    style E fill:#fce4ec
    style F fill:#f1f8e9
    style G fill:#fff8e1
```

### Active Directory Components

#### 1. **Forest**
- Top-level container for AD objects
- Contains one or more domains
- Establishes trust relationships

#### 2. **Domain**
- Logical grouping of AD objects
- Has its own security policies
- Can contain multiple OUs

#### 3. **Organizational Unit (OU)**
- Container for organizing AD objects
- Can have Group Policy applied
- Enables delegation of administration

#### 4. **Domain Controllers**
- Servers that authenticate users
- Store AD database
- Replicate changes to other DCs

### Active Directory Security Features

#### Group Policy
Group Policy allows administrators to centrally manage user and computer settings.

```bash
# Example Group Policy Settings
Computer Configuration:
- Password policies
- Account lockout policies
- Security settings
- Software installation

User Configuration:
- Desktop settings
- Application restrictions
- Folder redirection
- Scripts
```

#### Trust Relationships
Trusts enable users in one domain to access resources in another domain.

**Trust Types**:
- **One-Way Trust**: Domain A trusts Domain B, but not vice versa
- **Two-Way Trust**: Both domains trust each other
- **Transitive Trust**: Trust extends through multiple domains

### Active Directory Deployment

#### Installation Steps
1. **Prepare the Environment**
   - Ensure DNS is properly configured
   - Verify network connectivity
   - Plan domain structure

2. **Install Active Directory Domain Services**

    style B fill:#f3e5f5
    style C fill:#e8f5e8
    style D fill:#fff3e0
    style E fill:#fce4ec
```

#### SAML Flow
1. **User** requests access to Service Provider
2. **Service Provider** redirects to Identity Provider
3. **Identity Provider** authenticates user
4. **Identity Provider** sends SAML assertion to Service Provider
5. **Service Provider** validates assertion and grants access

### OAuth 2.0

OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework that allows third-party applications to access resources on behalf of users.

#### OAuth 2.0 Roles

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[OAuth 2.0 Flow] --> B[Resource Owner]
    A --> C[Client Application]
    A --> D[Authorization Server]
    A --> E[Resource Server]
    
    B --> B1[User with resources]
    B --> B2[Grants permission]
    
    C --> C1[Third-party app]
    C --> C2[Requests access]

    style E fill:#fce4ec
    style F fill:#e8f5e8
    style G fill:#fff3e0
    style H fill:#fce4ec
```

#### OAuth 2.0 Grant Types
- **Authorization Code**: Most secure, for web applications
- **Implicit**: Less secure, for mobile/JavaScript apps
- **Client Credentials**: For machine-to-machine communication
- **Resource Owner Password**: For trusted applications

### OpenID Connect

OpenID Connect extends OAuth 2.0 to provide authentication information, not just authorization.

#### OpenID Connect Benefits
- **Standardized**: Industry-standard authentication protocol
- **Secure**: Built on OAuth 2.0 security model
- **Flexible**: Supports various authentication methods
- **Interoperable**: Works across different platforms

## 🎭 Access Control Models: RBAC and ABAC

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

    style E fill:#fce4ec
    style F fill:#e8f5e8
    style G fill:#fff3e0
    style H fill:#fce4ec
```

#### RBAC Implementation Example
```bash
# Define roles
role Administrator {
    permissions: ["read", "write", "delete", "execute"]
    resources: ["*"]
}

role Manager {
    permissions: ["read", "write"]
    resources: ["/data/sales/*", "/reports/*"]
}

role Employee {
    permissions: ["read"]
    resources: ["/data/sales/own/*"]
}

# Assign users to roles
assign john.doe to Administrator
assign jane.smith to Manager
assign bob.johnson to Employee
```

### Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)

ABAC makes access decisions based on attributes of users, resources, actions, and environment.

#### ABAC Attributes

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[ABAC Decision] --> B[User Attributes]
    A --> C[Resource Attributes]
    A --> D[Action Attributes]
    A --> E[Environment Attributes]

    C --> C1[Classification]
    C --> C2[Owner]
    C --> C3[Location]
    C --> C4[Data Type]
    
    D --> D1[Operation]
    D --> D2[Risk Level]
    D --> D3[Audit Required]
    
    E --> E1[Time]
    E --> E2[Location]
    E --> E3[Network]

    style B fill:#f3e5f5
    style C fill:#e8f5e8
    style D fill:#fff3e0
    style E fill:#fce4ec
```

#### ABAC Policy Example
```bash
# Policy: Allow managers to read sales data during business hours
policy "Sales Data Access" {
    effect: "allow"
    condition: {
        user.department == "Sales" AND
        user.role == "Manager" AND
        resource.type == "Sales Data" AND
        action == "read" AND
        time.hour >= 8 AND time.hour <= 18
    }
}
```
