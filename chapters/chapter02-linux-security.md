    B --> C[User Input]
    C --> D[Command Execution]
    D --> E[Output Display]
    
    B --> B1[username@hostname:directory$]
    C --> C1[ls -la]
    D --> D1[System processes command]
    E --> E1[File listing displayed]
    
    style A fill:#e3f2fd
    style B fill:#f3e5f5
    style C fill:#e8f5e8
    style D fill:#fff3e0
    style E fill:#fce4ec
```

### Basic Command Structure
```bash
command [options] [arguments]
```

**Example**: `ls -la /home/user`
- `ls` = command (list files)
- `-la` = options (all files, long format)
- `/home/user` = argument (directory path)

### Essential Navigation Commands

| Command | Purpose | Example | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| `pwd` | Print working directory | `pwd` | Shows current directory path |
| `ls` | List files | `ls -la` | Lists all files with details |
| `cd` | Change directory | `cd /etc` | Moves to specified directory |
| `mkdir` | Make directory | `mkdir security` | Creates new directory |
| `rmdir` | Remove directory | `rmdir empty_folder` | Removes empty directory |
| `cp` | Copy files | `cp file1 file2` | Copies file1 to file2 |
| `mv` | Move/rename | `mv old.txt new.txt` | Renames or moves files |
| `rm` | Remove files | `rm file.txt` | Deletes specified file |

### File System Navigation

    style D fill:#fff3e0
    style E fill:#fce4ec
    style F fill:#f1f8e9
```

## üîí File Permissions and Security

Understanding file permissions is crucial for cybersecurity as it controls who can access, modify, or execute files on the system.

### Permission Types

```mermaid

    A[File Permissions] --> B[Read r]
    A --> C[Write w]
    A --> D[Execute x]
    
    B --> B1[View file contents]
    C --> C1[Modify file contents]
    D --> D1[Run file as program]
    
    B1 --> B2[ls -l shows: r--]
    C1 --> C2[ls -l shows: -w-]
    D1 --> D2[ls -l shows: --x]
    
    style A fill:#e3f2fd
    style B fill:#f3e5f5
    style C fill:#e8f5e8
    style D fill:#fff3e0
```

### Permission Categories
- **Owner**: The user who created the file
- **Group**: Members of the file's group
- **Others**: Everyone else on the system

### Understanding Permission Notation

```bash
-rw-r--r-- 1 user group 1024 Jan 15 10:30 file.txt
```

Breaking this down:
- **File Type**: `-` (regular file), `d` (directory), `l` (symbolic link)
- **Owner Permissions**: `rw-` (read, write, no execute)
- **Group Permissions**: `r--` (read only)
- **Others Permissions**: `r--` (read only)
- **Number of Links**: `1`
- **Owner**: `user`
- **Group**: `group`
- **Size**: `1024` bytes
- **Date**: `Jan 15 10:30`
- **Filename**: `file.txt`

### Changing Permissions with chmod

```bash
# Numeric method (octal)
chmod 755 file.txt    # Owner: rwx, Group: r-x, Others: r-x
chmod 644 file.txt    # Owner: rw-, Group: r--, Others: r--

# Symbolic method
chmod u+x file.txt    # Add execute for owner
chmod g-w file.txt    # Remove write for group
chmod o=r file.txt    # Set others to read-only
```

### Security Best Practices
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Only grant necessary permissions
- **Regular Audits**: Periodically review file permissions
- **Secure Defaults**: Set restrictive permissions by default
- **Monitor Changes**: Track permission modifications

    style D fill:#fff3e0
    style E fill:#fce4ec
```

### Basic Docker Commands

```bash
# Search for security tool images
docker search nmap

# Pull an image
docker pull uzyexe/nmap

# Run a container
docker run -it uzyexe/nmap nmap -sS 192.168.1.1

# List running containers
docker ps

# List all containers
docker ps -a

# Stop a container
docker stop container_id

# Remove a container
docker rm container_id

# Remove an image
docker rmi image_name
```

### Running Security Tools with Docker

#### Example 1: Nmap Network Scanner
```bash
# Run nmap scan from Docker container
docker run -it --rm uzyexe/nmap nmap -sS -p 80,443,22 192.168.1.1
```

#### Example 2: Nikto Web Scanner
```bash
# Run nikto web vulnerability scan
docker run -it --rm uzyexe/nikto -h http://example.com
```

#### Example 3: Custom Security Tool Container
```bash
# Create Dockerfile for custom security environment
FROM kalilinux/kali-rolling
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y nmap nikto hydra
WORKDIR /tools
CMD ["/bin/bash"]
```

## üìú Bash Scripting for Security Automation

Bash scripting allows cybersecurity professionals to automate repetitive tasks, making security operations more efficient and consistent.

### Why Learn Bash Scripting?

- **Automation**: Reduce manual, repetitive tasks
- **Consistency**: Ensure security procedures are followed exactly
- **Efficiency**: Speed up security operations
- **Documentation**: Scripts serve as procedural documentation

### Basic Bash Script Structure

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Script Name: security_scan.sh
# Description: Automated security scan script
# Author: Your Name
# Date: 2024

# Variables
TARGET_IP="192.168.1.1"
SCAN_RESULTS="/tmp/scan_results.txt"
LOG_FILE="/var/log/security_scan.log"

# Functions
log_message() {
    echo "$(date): $1" >> "$LOG_FILE"
}

# Main script
log_message "Starting security scan of $TARGET_IP"

# Run nmap scan
nmap -sS -p 1-1000 "$TARGET_IP" > "$SCAN_RESULTS"

# Check for open ports
if grep -q "open" "$SCAN_RESULTS"; then
    log_message "Open ports found on $TARGET_IP"
    cat "$SCAN_RESULTS"
else
    log_message "No open ports found on $TARGET_IP"
fi

log_message "Security scan completed"
```

### Essential Bash Concepts for Security

#### 1. **Variables and Environment**
```bash
# Set variables
TARGET="192.168.1.1"
PORTS="22,80,443,8080"

# Use variables
nmap -sS -p "$PORTS" "$TARGET"
```

#### 2. **Conditional Statements**
```bash
if [ -f "$SCAN_FILE" ]; then
    echo "Scan file exists"
    cat "$SCAN_FILE"
else
    echo "Scan file not found"
fi
```

#### 3. **Loops**
```bash
# Loop through IP addresses
for ip in 192.168.1.{1..10}; do
    echo "Scanning $ip..."
    nmap -sS "$ip" >> "scan_results.txt"
done
```

#### 4. **Functions**
```bash
scan_port() {
    local ip=$1
    local port=$2
    nc -zv "$ip" "$port" 2>&1 | grep -q "open" && echo "Port $port is open"
}

# Use function
scan_port "192.168.1.1" "22"
```

### Practical Security Script Examples

#### Example 1: Port Scanner
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Simple port scanner

TARGET=${1:-"127.0.0.1"}
PORTS=${2:-"22,80,443,8080"}

echo "Scanning $TARGET on ports $PORTS"

IFS=',' read -ra PORT_ARRAY <<< "$PORTS"
for port in "${PORT_ARRAY[@]}"; do
    (echo >/dev/tcp/$TARGET/$port) >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "Port $port is open" || echo "Port $port is closed"
done
```

#### Example 2: Log Monitor
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Monitor security logs for suspicious activity

LOG_FILE="/var/log/auth.log"
ALERT_FILE="/tmp/security_alerts.txt"

echo "Monitoring $LOG_FILE for suspicious activity..."

tail -f "$LOG_FILE" | while read line; do
    if echo "$line" | grep -q "Failed password\|Invalid user\|authentication failure"; then
        echo "$(date): SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY DETECTED - $line" >> "$ALERT_FILE"
        echo "ALERT: $line"
    fi
done
```
