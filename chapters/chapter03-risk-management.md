## 🎲 What is Risk Management?

Risk management is the systematic process of identifying, analyzing, evaluating, and treating risks to minimize their potential impact on an organization's objectives. In cybersecurity, this means protecting information assets while enabling business operations.

### The Risk Management Paradox

Organizations face a fundamental challenge: **too much security can hinder business operations, while too little security creates unacceptable risks**. Risk management provides the framework to find the right balance.

**Example**: A bank needs to allow customers to access their accounts online (business requirement) while protecting against fraud and data theft (security requirement). Risk management helps determine the appropriate security controls.

## 🔄 The Risk Management Lifecycle

Risk management is not a one-time activity but a continuous process that adapts to changing threats and business conditions.

## 🏗️ ISO 27005: Information Security Risk Management

ISO 27005 is the international standard that provides guidelines for information security risk management. It's part of the ISO 27000 family of standards and provides a structured approach to managing information security risks.

```

### 1. Context Establishment

**Purpose**: Define the scope, boundaries, and criteria for risk management activities.

**Key Components**:
- **Risk Management Policy**: High-level statement of commitment and approach
- **Scope Definition**: What's included and excluded from risk management
- **Risk Criteria**: How risks will be evaluated and prioritized
- **Stakeholder Identification**: Who has an interest in risk management outcomes

**Example Policy Statement**:
> "Our organization is committed to managing information security risks to protect our assets, enable business operations, and maintain stakeholder trust. We will identify, assess, and treat risks in accordance with ISO 27005 guidelines."

### 2. Risk Assessment

The core of risk management involves three interconnected activities:

#### A. Risk Identification
**Purpose**: Find all potential risks that could affect information security.

**Techniques**:
- **Asset Inventory**: List all information assets (data, systems, people, processes)
- **Threat Modeling**: Identify potential threat sources and attack vectors
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Find weaknesses that threats could exploit
- **Scenario Analysis**: Consider "what if" situations

**Asset Classification Example**:
```mermaid

    style C fill:#e8f5e8
    style D fill:#fff3e0
    style E fill:#fce4ec
```

#### B. Risk Analysis
**Purpose**: Understand the likelihood and impact of identified risks.

**Risk Calculation Formula**:
```
Risk = Likelihood × Impact
```

**Likelihood Assessment Scale**:
| Level | Description | Probability Range |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Very Low | < 5% |
| 2 | Low | 5-20% |
| 3 | Medium | 21-50% |
| 4 | High | 51-80% |
| 5 | Very High | > 80% |

**Impact Assessment Scale**:
| Level | Description | Business Impact |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1 | Very Low | Minimal disruption, < $10K |
| 2 | Low | Minor disruption, $10K-$100K |
| 3 | Medium | Moderate disruption, $100K-$1M |
| 4 | High | Significant disruption, $1M-$10M |
| 5 | Very High | Critical disruption, > $10M |

**Risk Levels**:
- **Green (1-4)**: Low risk, accept or monitor
- **Yellow (6-12)**: Medium risk, treat or transfer
- **Red (15-25)**: High risk, treat immediately

#### C. Risk Evaluation
**Purpose**: Compare calculated risks against risk criteria to determine treatment priorities.

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- **Risk Appetite**: Organization's willingness to accept risk
- **Risk Tolerance**: Maximum acceptable risk level
- **Legal/Regulatory Requirements**: Mandatory risk levels
- **Business Impact**: Effect on business objectives

### 3. Risk Treatment

    style B fill:#f3e5f5
    style C1 fill:#e8f5e8
    style C2 fill:#fff3e0
    style C3 fill:#fce4ec
```

### Risk Prioritization Factors

1. **Risk Score**: Higher scores get higher priority
2. **Business Impact**: Critical business functions get priority
3. **Regulatory Requirements**: Mandatory compliance gets priority
4. **Resource Availability**: Consider implementation costs and effort
5. **Time Sensitivity**: Urgent threats get immediate attention

## 📋 Risk Treatment Planning

A comprehensive risk treatment plan addresses how each risk will be managed.

### Risk Treatment Plan Template

| Risk ID | Risk Description | Risk Score | Treatment Option | Controls | Owner | Timeline | Cost | Status |
|---------|------------------|------------|------------------|----------|-------|----------|------|--------|
| R001 | Unpatched systems vulnerable to ransomware | 20 | Reduce | Patch management, vulnerability scanning | IT Manager | 30 days | $50K | In Progress |
| R002 | Weak password policies | 15 | Reduce | MFA, password complexity, training | Security Team | 60 days | $25K | Planned |
| R003 | Unencrypted data transmission | 12 | Reduce | TLS implementation, VPN | Network Team | 90 days | $75K | Planned |

### Control Selection Criteria

When selecting controls, consider:

1. **Effectiveness**: How well does it reduce risk?
2. **Cost**: What's the implementation and maintenance cost?
3. **Complexity**: How difficult is it to implement?
4. **Maintenance**: What ongoing effort is required?
5. **Integration**: How well does it work with existing systems?

## 📈 Executive Risk Reporting
