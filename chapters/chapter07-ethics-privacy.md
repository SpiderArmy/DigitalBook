- **Example**: How would this look in the news or on social media?

#### 3. **The Reversibility Test**
- **Principle**: Would you accept this decision if you were affected?
- **Application**: Put yourself in others' shoes
- **Example**: How would you feel if this happened to you?

#### 4. **The Harm Test**
- **Principle**: Does this action cause unnecessary harm?
- **Application**: Evaluate potential negative consequences
- **Example**: What harm could result from this decision?

### Common Ethical Dilemmas

#### 1. **Security vs. Privacy**
**Scenario**: Implementing monitoring systems that collect user data for security purposes.

**Ethical Considerations**:
- **Security Benefits**: Protection against threats
- **Privacy Costs**: Intrusion into personal information
- **Balance**: Minimize data collection while maintaining security

**Resolution**: Implement privacy-preserving monitoring that collects only necessary data.

#### 2. **Transparency vs. Security**
**Scenario**: Disclosing security vulnerabilities that could help attackers.

**Ethical Considerations**:
- **Transparency Benefits**: User awareness and trust
- **Security Risks**: Potential exploitation by attackers
- **Balance**: Responsible disclosure with appropriate timing

**Resolution**: Coordinate disclosure with affected parties and provide patches.

#### 3. **Access vs. Control**
**Scenario**: Balancing legitimate access needs with security controls.

**Ethical Considerations**:
- **Access Benefits**: Business functionality and user productivity
- **Control Benefits**: Security and data protection
- **Balance**: Appropriate access with necessary controls

**Resolution**: Implement role-based access with least privilege principles.
