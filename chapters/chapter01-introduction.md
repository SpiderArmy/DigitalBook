## 🔐 What is Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks, damage, or unauthorized access. Think of it as the digital equivalent of home security - just as you lock your doors and install security cameras to protect your physical home, cybersecurity measures protect your digital assets.

### The Digital Transformation

In today's interconnected world, almost everything we do involves technology:
- **Personal**: Social media, online banking, smart home devices
- **Business**: Cloud computing, remote work, digital payments
- **Government**: Critical infrastructure, public services, national security
- **Healthcare**: Electronic health records, medical devices, telemedicine

This digital transformation has created unprecedented opportunities but also new vulnerabilities that cybercriminals can exploit.

## 🛡️ The CIA Triad: Foundation of Cybersecurity

The CIA triad represents the three fundamental principles of cybersecurity:

    A --> D[Availability]
    
    B --> B1[Information is accessible only to authorized users]

    D --> D1[Information is accessible when needed]
    
    B1 --> B2[Examples: Encryption, Access Controls, Authentication]
    C1 --> C2[Examples: Digital Signatures, Checksums, Version Control]

    style A fill:#e1f5fe
    style B fill:#f3e5f5
    style C fill:#e8f5e8
    style D fill:#fff3e0
```

### 1. Confidentiality
**Definition**: Ensuring that information is accessible only to those who are authorized to access it.

**Real-world Example**: When you log into your bank account, the system ensures that only you can see your financial information, not other customers or unauthorized individuals.

**How it's achieved**:
- **Encryption**: Scrambling data so only authorized parties can read it
- **Access Controls**: Limiting who can access specific information
- **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of users before granting access

### 2. Integrity
**Definition**: Maintaining the accuracy and completeness of data throughout its lifecycle.

**Real-world Example**: When you send an email, integrity ensures that the message arrives exactly as you wrote it, without any changes or corruption.

**How it's achieved**:
- **Digital Signatures**: Mathematical proof that data hasn't been altered
- **Checksums**: Mathematical values that detect data corruption
- **Version Control**: Tracking changes to maintain data accuracy

### 3. Availability
**Definition**: Ensuring that authorized users have access to information and systems when needed.

**Real-world Example**: When you need to access your email or online services, availability ensures these services are up and running 24/7.

**How it's achieved**:
- **Redundancy**: Having backup systems in case of failure
- **Backup Systems**: Regular copies of data for recovery
- **Disaster Recovery**: Plans to restore services after major incidents

```

### 1. Malware (Malicious Software)
**Definition**: Software designed to harm systems, steal data, or gain unauthorized access.

**Common Types**:
- **Viruses**: Self-replicating programs that attach to legitimate files
- **Worms**: Self-replicating programs that spread through networks
- **Trojans**: Malicious programs disguised as legitimate software
